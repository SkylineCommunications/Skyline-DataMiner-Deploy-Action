# Skyline DataMiner Deploy Action

### `solution-path`

**Required** The path to the .sln file of the solution. Atm only DataMiner Automation Script solutions are supported. E.g. `'./Example/Script.sln'`.

### `package-name`

**Required** The chosen name for the package. E.g. `'MyPackageName'`.

### `version`

**Required** 
The version number for the package (format A.B.C). E.g. `'1.0.1'`.
